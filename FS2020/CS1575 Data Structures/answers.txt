Q1 - function print_vector on line 48

Q2 - The bug is in line 46 ( while(print_this.size()) )
	because the parameter of the while loop is a constant, it
	always registers as true and executes. This is fixed by
	adding in "i < " before print_this.size().

Q3 - because the i in the for loop on line 62 is not incremented 
	after every loop, the end case is never met.

Q4 - in the for loopon line 68 -- part of the vector_sum 
	function -- the end case is when i is greater than sum_this.size(). 
	because i was initialized with its value set to 0 instead of 1, 
	we want the loop to end when i equals sum_this.size, so this bug 
	can be fixed by removing the '=' sign.
