Programming assignment 5 (PA05)
===============================

# Linked list (std::list)
---

## Assignment description
Mimic the **std::list** behavior with your MyList (must use a **doubly linked list**). In addition, you must use exactly ONE (not two) sentinel/dummy node (to which the m_sentinel pointer points), which is linked to the last and first elements of the list at all times. This is different than the DLL example that had been shown in class which used two sentinel nodes (one for the head and one for the tail). Using the sentinel node in this case should still provide you the convenience of simplifying the *insert*, *append*, and *remove* methods by eliminating all need for special-case code when the list is empty, or when inserting at the head or tail of the list.

## Input/Output
Given only indirectly this time.The sample input and output are defined in
terms of the behavior of the std::list (which you must fully test yourself).

## Grading
100% of this assignment will be graded based on the successful implementation of the functions in the header file using unit testing.
Each function's performance on its own unit test will be worth a certain subset of those points, and the output of main will as well.
