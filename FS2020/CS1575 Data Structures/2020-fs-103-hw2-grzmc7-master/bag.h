/* TODO1: Create an abstract templated class 'Bag' which will serve as an
    interface to the two other derived bag implementations.
 * This is the ONE h file you CAN edit.
 * You must include the following *pure virtual* functions:
    - insert()
    - remove()
    - size()
    - remember, you do not need to have a implementation body for a PVF; thus,
        do you need a bag.hpp file?
 * The name of the templated abstract class (templated on T) should be Bag, look
    at the header files of the other two bag implementations for guidance
 * TODO2: Include a public member variable in your abstract class
    - std::string parent_variable = "this is from the abstract class";
