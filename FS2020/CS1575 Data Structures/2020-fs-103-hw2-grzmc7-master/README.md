## What is this repository?
The files listed here are the starting point for your assignment.
Only add source files (not compiled files) to the Git repository.

## Note (actually do this)!!
Thoroughly read the Canvas page **How to: Homework Submissions** for good tips, tricks, hints, and instructions on programming assignments, including how to submit via Git.

* Remember, only cpp files should be compiled, not h or hpp, and never include a cpp file via #include.

## Assignment description
The bag is one of the *simplest* data structures. A bag is a collection of objects where you can keep adding objects to the bag. So with a bag data
structure, you can collect all the objects, and then iterate through them. Read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)#Multiset
See the headers of each of the files in this repository for instructions. The first step is to read all the code and see how it works together (start with **pa02.cpp**).

## Due date
Please see the canvas assignment schedule for all due dates.
