/* This is a simple main, which is here for you to mess with and to verify your
    code (not as a graded component of the assignment)
 * This should serve as a starting point for your unit testing.
 *
 * Assignment:
 * The bag is one of the simplest data structures.
 * Read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)#Multiset

 * Task 1
 *  - implement the custom exception in the my_exception.cpp file

 * Task 2
 *  - implement an abstract tempated class in bag.h

 * Task 3
 *  - read and understand the simple bag class
 *  - edit bag_simple.hpp to make the insert item throw our custom exception

 * Task 4
 *  - read and understand the dynamic bag class
 *  - implement the occurrences function in the hpp file
 *  - fix the memory leak in bag_dyn.hpp
